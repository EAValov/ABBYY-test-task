I like C# for the expressiveness and nice features.
Quickly and independently study new things. Challenges gives me an incentive to develop myself.
Most of all I have been working with .NET and related technologies - Sql Server, ASP.NET MVC, WCF, WPF/WinForms. 
I prefer to write queries by hands + Dapper. ORM is nice, but my approach seems to me easier and it works faster.
Try to stick SOLID and common sense, apply design patterns without fanaticism. Try to use Unit tests and TDD when it's possible.
I have an experience of making DIY electronic devices with Arduino, thats why i'm always careful with memory consumption and expensive algorithms.
Read the professional literature, collect experience and best practices.

Got everything i need to work remotely - a new PC, quiet working conditions, all types of communication and reliable connection with backup uplink.
